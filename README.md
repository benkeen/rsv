## Really Simple Validation (RSV)

Really Simple Validation (RSV) is a tried-and-tested javascript validation library I wrote back in the late
paleolithic era. Additional code contributed by Mihai Ionescu and Nathan Howard.

This powerful little script lets you add client-side validation to any webform with very little work. It includes
a number of pre-existing routines for common tasks like validating email addresses, numbers, and other field
content, and provides a simple mechanism to extend it to whatever custom functions you need. For documentation
and examples, please visit:

There are three flavours:
1. /standalone - contains a self-contained script with no other dependencies.
2. /jquery - RSV as a jQuery plugin
3. /prototype - RSV as a Prototype plugin

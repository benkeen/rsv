Really Simple Validation (RSV) is a tried-and-tested javascript validation library I wrote back in the late paleolithic era. Additional code contributed by Mihai Ionescu and Nathan Howard.

This powerful little script lets you add client-side validation to any webform with very little work. It includes a number of pre-existing routines for common tasks like validating email addresses, numbers, and other field content, and provides a simple mechanism to extend it to whatever custom functions you need.

There are three flavours:
1. /standalone - contains a self-contained script with no other dependencies.
2. /jquery - RSV as a jQuery plugin
3. /prototype - RSV as a Prototype plugin
